# multi-PDF-Chatter
The Multi-PDF Chatter project is a powerful question-answering system that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with the content through natural language queries. The system is built using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface, where users can upload multiple PDFs and ask questions related to the content.
